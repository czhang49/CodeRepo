test-results-analyzer
=====================

Many of us have a requirement of knowing the execution status of a test package , test class or test-method across multiple builds. This plugin is an implementation of the said requirement and shows a table containing the executions status of a package,class or a test-method across builds.

The results are shown in a tree grid hierarchy and user has the provision to drill-down to test-method level to see the execution status of the respective set across multiple builds.

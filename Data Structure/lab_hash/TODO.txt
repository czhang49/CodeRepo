1. update the testing classes to use the following template:
       template <template <class K, class V> class HT>
   to allow for templatized hashtables (like AnagramFinder<SCHashTable>).

2. document the iterator setups, but don't document the classes themselves
   (so they do not appear in students' doxygen)
